Hi. I'm Abhiram
==================

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at O9 Solutions, a supply chain based company in Bangalore. I like coding in Python and R, reading fiction/non-fiction and writing short stories [1]. I also co-created and run Broke Bibliophiles Bangalore [2], a reading community in Bangalore (2017 - present).
If you'd like to learn new concepts in Python and Data/ML Engineering, subscribe to my newsletter and you'll be notified with each new issue - https://everythingpython.substack.com!

If you'd like to talk about any of the above or just tell me about something in Greek Mythology, mail me!
